Highway King
================================================================================

This is a 2D iOS game where the player conducts the movement and position of
large semi trucks making deliveries. Its gameplay is similar to *Flight
Control*, whereby vehicles are directed using lines drawn on the screen by the
player.

The game was developed by myself and my brother, James. All of the assets in
the game were created by James, while the programming was done by both of us.

This game is one of the first Objective-C projects that we ever did, so the
code is not "conventional", to say the least. Readers can skim the code and learn
the wrong ways to make a game and what to avoid. (Such as the use of raw OpenGL
code in random places, grotesque abuse of global state, etc.)
